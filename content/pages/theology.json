Often referred to as sibling faiths due to their shared monotheistic belief, their common patriarch Abraham, and interconnected scriptures, they nonetheless diverge in profound ways that make reconciliation of their core beliefs appear nearly impossible."

          "content": "The most fundamental divergence among the Abrahamic faiths lies in their understanding of the nature of God. Judaism emphasizes the absolute oneness and indivisibility of God. Christianity introduces the concept of the Trinity, while Islam maintains a strict understanding of God's oneness, or Tawhid."

Their differences regarding the nature of God, the role of Jesus, the status of scripture, and the concept of salvation create theological boundaries that are not easily bridged."
